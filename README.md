# EFY Apps

The website + a collection of static apps built with [efy](https://github.com/dragos-efy/efy).

Try the [live demos](https://efy.ooo) for testing, but if you want to personally use the apps regularly, download them to your device or set up your own instances, to not consume server resources here. You don't need a server or nodejs, just a browser and to open the html files, but it works either way. They are offline as well.

Documentation is coming soon...
